## Pushing Replacement 

If you'd like to replace the top page of the stack with another page, you can use
`pushReplacement` or `pushReplacementNamed`. This is equivalent to the sequence of
calling `pop` then `push` methods. Unlike popping then pushing, `pushReplacement`
or `pushReplacementNamed` will be unnoticeable by the user if, and only if, the 
replaced page has the same `fullpath` as the new page (i.e. the `pageKey` will
not change). 

Pushing replacement becomes useful when an application would like to maintain the 
stack under a page with nested navigation without compromising the UX during the 
nested navigation activity (e.g. changing a tab within a `TabBar`).
